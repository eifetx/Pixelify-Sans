# Pixelify-Sans
Pixelify Sans fonts are a unique style of typography that originated in the 1980s with the rise of computer graphics and video games. Pixel fonts are characterized by their blocky, pixelated appearance, which is achieved by using a grid of small, square pixels to create each letterform.

My Pixel Font product is a collection of digital fonts designed specifically for use in digital media, such as websites, mobile apps, video games, and other digital interfaces.
